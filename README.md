# TDRCB
 Tudor's Discord Remote Control Bot
 <br>
<b> Only working on Windows.</b>

## Required PIP Packages
pyinstaller (only needed to compile the code to an exe), discord.py, pyautogui, pygetwindow, psutil, Pillow

## Bot creation and getting a token
Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications and create a new application. On the 'bot' tab of the application, uncheck 'public bot' so only you can add it and turn on the message intent. Press 'reset token' and copy the given token. Go to OAuth2 and URL Generator and tick the 'bot' scope. Copy the link and add it to your server. Not making this a public bot + adding this into an empty server with just you ensures that no one else will use the bot to do stuff on your computer.
